### Overview
The architecture diagram illustrates the workflow of the EUR/USD stock prediction project. Below is a breakdown of the key components:

1. **Data Source**: Market data is retrieved from Yahoo Finance.
2. **Data Processing**: The data is transformed into Parquet format for efficient storage and processing.
3. **Model Training**:
   - **Regression Models**: These models analyze historical data to predict stock price trends.
   - **Classification Model**: This model classifies the predicted actions (Buy/Sell) based on the generated features.
4. **First Result**: Predictions from the regression models are saved in JSON format for easy access and further use.
5. **Further Data Processing**: The results from the regression models are added back to the original Parquet file for reprocessing and the creation of new features for the classification model.
6. **Second Result**: Predictions from the classification model (Buy/Sell actions) are also saved in JSON format for easy access.
7. **Web Interface**: A Flask-based web application is used to present the predictions to the users via an interactive interface.
